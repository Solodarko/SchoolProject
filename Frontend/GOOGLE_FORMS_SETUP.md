## Step 3: Get Form URL and Entry IDs

3. Copy the URL - it will look like:
   ```

   ```

### Get Entry IDs:
1. Open your form in preview mode
2. Right-click on the first field and select "Inspect Element"
3. Look for the `name` attribute - it will be something like `entry.123456789`
4. Record the entry ID for each field

Example entry IDs you'll find:
```
Full Name: entry.123456789
Email: entry.987654321
Student ID: entry.111222333
Phone: entry.444555666
Organization: entry.777888999
Position: entry.101112131
Notes: entry.141516171
Session Title: entry.181920212
QR Code ID: entry.223344556
Session Time: entry.334455667
Location: entry.445566778
Metadata: entry.556677889
```

## Step 4: Update the Code

Replace the placeholder values in `AdminQRGenerator.jsx`:

```javascript
// Replace this line:
const googleFormBaseUrl = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_YOUR_FORM_ID_HERE/viewform';

// With your actual form URL:
const googleFormBaseUrl = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_YOUR_ACTUAL_FORM_ID/viewform';

// Update all the entry IDs with your actual ones:
params.set('entry.123456789', qrData.attendanceConfig?.sessionTitle); // Session Title
params.set('entry.987654321', qrData.id); // QR Code ID
// ... etc for all fields
```

## Step 5: Set Up Form Response Collection

### Create a Spreadsheet:
1. In your Google Form, click "Responses" tab
2. Click the Google Sheets icon to create a spreadsheet
3. Choose "Create a new spreadsheet"
4. Name it "QR Attendance Responses"

### Optional - Set up Email Notifications:
1. In the "Responses" tab, click the â‹® menu
2. Select "Get email notifications for new responses"
3. This will email you whenever someone submits attendance

## Step 6: Test the System

1. Generate a QR code from your admin dashboard
2. Scan it with your mobile phone
3. Verify that:
   - Google Form opens in mobile browser
   - Fields are pre-filled with user data
   - Form submits successfully
   - Response appears in your Google Sheet

## Example Pre-filled Google Form URL

When a user scans the QR code, they'll be redirected to a URL like this:

```
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform?
entry.123456789=Attendance%20Session%20-%20Dec%2021,%202024%2010:30&
entry.987654321=attendance_1640089800000&
entry.111222333=John%20Doe&
entry.444555666=john.doe@school.edu&
entry.777888999=STU123456&
entry.101112131=Computer%20Science
```
